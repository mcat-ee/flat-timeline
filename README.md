[Demo Site](https://mcat-ee.github.io/flat-timeline/index)

# Using this application

0. Take a look at the page in action above, note the event variables and how they're stored in index.html

1. Edit the JSON variable within index.html to suit your purposes

2. View your changes with a webserver (if you view them without a server your browser may block the file:// resources)

    * If you have Python installed, try `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

    * If you have node installed, try `npm install http-server -g` and then `http-server`
